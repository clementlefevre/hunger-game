Hunger Game - Flask webapp.
======

This repository contains the source code examples for a simple app developped thanks to the great tutorial of Miguel Grinberg-Flask Web Development / O'reilly.
I just reused the nice authentification process and my own sauce, a polling system for colleagues to vote for the place we go for lunchtime.
The deployment on heroku is (as of today 21st Jan 2016) free of charge, using a PostgreSQL DB.

Do not use a SQLite db on Heroku.

Enjoy your meal !
